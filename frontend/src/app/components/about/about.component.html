      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        We live in a world where travel is often seen as an escape, a luxury, a way to disconnect. 
        But what if travel wasn’t just about seeing new places, but about <strong>respecting them</strong>? 
        What if, instead of leaving a trail of carbon footprints, we could leave a legacy of conscious choices?
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        That’s why we created <strong>PlanItGo ECO</strong>—not to sell you an illusion of a perfectly sustainable trip 
        (because let’s be honest, in today’s world, true sustainability is a privilege few can fully afford), 
        but to <strong>help you make the best choices within what is possible</strong>.
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        We know that traveling without any environmental impact is almost impossible. 
        We live in a society that still prioritizes convenience over responsibility, speed over sustainability. 
        But that doesn’t mean we should give up. <strong>Change doesn’t happen overnight—it happens with every small decision we make.</strong>
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mt-6 mb-2">PlanItGo ECO is here to guide you:</h2>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
        <li>🌱 To show you that choosing an eco-friendly hotel, a local organic restaurant, or a low-emission transport option isn’t just a trend—it’s a statement.</li>
        <li>🌍 To prove that exploring the world and protecting it can go hand in hand.</li>
        <li>💚 To remind you that the way we travel today shapes the world we leave behind.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p class="text-lg">
        This app is not about perfection; it’s about <strong>intention</strong>. 
        About traveling in a way that aligns with your values, even if it’s not 100% perfect. 
        Because every step towards sustainability, no matter how small, <strong>is a step in the right direction.</strong>
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 text-center text-green-700">
        So pack your bags—but pack them wisely. The world doesn’t need perfect travelers. It needs conscious ones. ✨
